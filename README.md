# python-for-datascience
A Python tutorial for (beginning) data scientists with a non-computer-science background

## Prerequisites (Audience, Skills)

To fully enjoy this tutorial, you are expected to:

- Be able to clone this repository using any git client
- Have some programming experience
- Have some conceptual understanding of basic data analysis such as filtering/selection, grouping by, aggregation, transformation

While the tutorial starts with an introduction into the most basic Python concepts, the pace will be too high for people that have no coding experience whatsoever.

## Prerequisites (Technical)

To run this tutorial, you need at least:

- Any computing environment with Python >= 3.7 installed and available
- Recent Pandas (>= 1.0) and Numpy packages available globally or in a virtual environment
- Jupyter Lab (or simple Notebook) installed globally or in a virtual environment
- Any git client that allows you to clone this repository

In case of any trouble meeting these prerequisites, [this article at Real Python](https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/) can be helpful. I suggest to either use a pyenv+pipenv - based environment or a conda - based environment, and not create a mix of these approaches.

Use this tutorial by cloning this repository into a directory of choice, and running `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` from that directory.
