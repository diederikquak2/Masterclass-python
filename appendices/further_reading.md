# Further Reading

To maintain focus on understanding the Python constructs that are used to create (and interact with) data science packages such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn, some otherwise important topics were left out of this tutorial:

### General

- The [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) is a good starting point for Python topics beyond those that were discussed in this tutorial, e.g. installation, virtual environments, (web) frameworks, etc.
- The [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) provide an introduction and in-depth tutorials for several important scientific computing packages.
- There are many ways to format code, but [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the "official" Python style guide.
- Handling errors and exceptions is explained in [the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) and [this tutorial at Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/).
- Python has several facilities for [Documenting code](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/).
- While `print()` calls are useful for short-term debugging purposes, eventually you'll need to use proper [logging](https://realpython.com/python-logging/).

### From Notebook to Package

Eventually, the chunks of code that we write in notebook cells and execute interactively may need to transition into reusable [_modules_ and _packages_](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/) that can run as scripts or be part of a larger IT system. The following ([[1]](https://godatadriven.com/blog/how-to-start-a-data-science-project-in-python/), [[2]](https://godatadriven.com/blog/write-less-terrible-code-with-jupyter-notebook/)) blogs introduce a useful workflow for such a transition.

### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
